He started playing the guitar at a young age and soon became a virtuoso performer and teacher. He traveled extensively throughout Europe, giving concerts and publishing his compositions. He settled in Paris, France, where he died in 1853.
 
Carcassi is best known for his Op. 60, a collection of 25 studies for the guitar, which are considered to be among the most important and influential works for the instrument. The studies cover various aspects of guitar technique and musical expression, such as scales, arpeggios, chords, slurs, harmonics, dynamics, and phrasing. They are also musically appealing and enjoyable to play. The studies are often played as solo pieces, but they can also be played as duets, as Carcassi himself suggested in the preface of the book.
 
Playing Carcassi's duets can bring you many benefits as a classical guitarist. You can improve your technical skills, such as finger strength, accuracy, speed, and coordination. You can also develop your musical skills, such as sight-reading, rhythm, intonation, tone quality, and interpretation. You can also have fun and share your passion with another guitarist. Playing duets can also help you prepare for ensemble playing or accompaniment.
